For my project, I used a population density map from https://geoawesomeness.com/amazing-interactive-map-of-6-3-billion-geotagged-tweets/world-population-density-map/
But you can use other maps (they need to have the same resolution 1920x1080)

I donÂ´t know if the pop_density.jpg is open-source, but I am using it for scientific reasons and I am not profiting from that.
